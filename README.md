Project Description:
  Existing Issue:
    1. Each Municipalities has limited Solid waste collection vehicles.
    2. Due to lack of proper collection system, the garbage is unnecessarily handled several times and
        even put on ground being finally put on transport vehicle.
    3. Due to lack of systemic study on the quantity and quality of garbage generated at the neighbourhood level, 
        monitoring is ineffictive, therby leading to lack of route optimisation leads to wasted mileage and power

  Solution:
    We have developed a android mobile app to capture the route coverage, vehicle type, garbage loaded at the site of land fill area.
    We have developed a Web Management Portal, which helps to identify the vehicles which are (better utilized, under utilized & over utilized)
      based on each vehicle mileage, route coverage distance, vehicle capacity and garbage loaded.
    These information helps to optimize the collection route of the vehicle to the land fill area.
    In future this can help to segregate the wet & solid waste collection effectively.
